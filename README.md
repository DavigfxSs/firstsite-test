#Hello everyone, I decided to upload this challenge because it was a little more challenging, I know its design isn't that beautiful, but there are more projects coming, this was the first site where I did the entire project from 0 and I adapted it, the intention it was exercising design.

#### The challenge goes was i create one page site and used Css to creat a design.

#### However, the design style doesn't satisfy me, I know I can make it much more beautiful, its pattern just matches what the teacher specified in the challenge.

#### I keep studying e you can wait new projects in web developer e progamming
